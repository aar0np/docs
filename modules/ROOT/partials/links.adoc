==  Links

There are two kind of links:

* External links that reference content outside the documentation
* Internal links that reference content inside the documentation


=== External Links

Prefix: `link:`

Reference: link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#links[AsciiDoctor Links]

A `link` follows this style: `http(s)://domain/#section[Printed Name]`

Where `#section` and `[Printed Name]` are optional components.

The `link:` prefix is **only** needed when the target is not a URI.
That's because the URI protocol is an implicit macro;
 in other words, http(s): is recognized as a macro prefix of an implicit link.

Example:
`https://github.com/stargate/docs/best-practices.adoc#_links[Links in the Best Practices doc]`

A URL may not display correctly when it contains characters such as underscores (\_)
or carets (\^)
Please see link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#complex-urls[Troubleshooting Complex URLs how to solve that.

This is an example of an URL containing problematic characters which needs special treatment:
`https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)`

AsciiDoc files can also use page-specific or global attributes to provide links.
Using such links greatly improves readability while authoring the document.

[source, plaintext]
----
= The Page Header
:internal-link-name-url: https://example.com/content/link_can_be_very_long

Text {internal-link-name-url}[highlighted text] text.
----

It is important that `:internal-link-name-url:` is placed directly below the page header.
Any number of these link attributes can be added.
As a matter of good practice, end your link attribute names with `-url`.

.NOTE
====
If you want to prevent automatic linking of a URL, prepend it with a backslash (\\).
This will create text but not a clickable link and can be used for example URLs.
This method helps prevent false positives when checking broken links.
For example:

[source, plaintext]
----
This is an example of an unlinked web address: \http://example.com
----
The above example renders as: `This is an example web address: \http://example.com`
with no clickable link.

for more possibilities.

=== Internal Links

Prefix: `xref:`

Reference: https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#xref[Cross Reference]

Arguably one of the most powerful features of AsciiDoc, an internal link called
a `cross reference` can link to:

* an in-page reference
* another documentation file, even in another repository
* a section title or anchor name inside a documentation file

All content you want to reference **must be** inside the directory structure of `modules/`
in one of the repositories used to build the documentation.

An `xref` is usually written in the following example style:

[source, plaintext]
----
xref:module_name:<path>/file.adoc#section[Printed Name
----

Where `module_name:`, `#section` and `[Printed Name]` are optional components.
`module_name:` is mandatory when referenced content is not in the same module.
`<path>` is the relative path via the module name to your referenced file.

You can reference a section or an anchor inside the same file, another file,
or another module.
Section titles automatically create references, where the text is converted to
lowercase characters and all special characters including an underscore are
converted to a dash (`_`).

You can create anchors manually anywhere in the page by using following methods:

* text `[[anchor-name]]` text (anchor-name will not be printed, it is only the reference point)
* text `[#anchor-name]#Anchor text to be referenced to#` text (Anchor text will be printed)

Reference Examples:

- This example references a section title inside the same document:

[source, plaintext]
----
xref:section-title[FAQ]
----

- This example references a manual anchor inside the same document:

[source, plaintext]
----
xref:anchor-name[FAQ]
----

- This example references another file:

[source, plaintext]
----
xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[Market app]
----

- This example references another file and a particular section title:

[source, plaintext]
----
xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#apps-commands[Market app]
----

- This example references another file in another module and a particular section title: <br/>

[source, plaintext]
----
xref:admin_manual:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc#apps-commands[Market app]
----

**Strongly** In general it`s advisable to use a ToC
([Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)) instead of a list of xrefÂ´s.

**Note:** Use a link checker regularly to find broken links to section titles
or anchors.
If an anchor link is broken, a build will not report an error as the page
itself is accessible.
