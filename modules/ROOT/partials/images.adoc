== Images

Prefix: `image`

Reference: link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#images[`Images`]

All images must to be stored in a path under `modules`/`module_name`/`assets/images`/`<path>`

An `image` is written in following example style:
[source, plaintext]
----
image:<path>/image_name[Alternative Image Text, options]
----

Please use the comma as separator for one or more options.

The `options` are optional, but can define attributes, like the sizing of an image,
(`width=40%`).

[source, plaintext]
----
image:configuration/files/encryption1.png[Encryption, width=40%]
----

There are two ways that an image is treated defined, using either
`image:` or `image::`

Using `image:` will make the image part of the text written.
Use this syntax when you want an image to be part of the text flow, like a referenced icon.

Using `image::` will put the image on a new line, centered by default.
The alignment can be set with `align="center|left|right"`.

**IMPORTANT**
Please be advised, in case you use an Alternative Image Text, not to use double
quotes to highlight some text elements.
Double quotes will be rendered properly when the html documentation is built,
but creating the pdf will return a warning that the string can not be parsed
and the complete image link is broken.
You can avoid that by using single quotes and ticks (not backticks!) instead.
