== File Locations

* All documents are written into the directory `modules`/`module_name`/`pages`/`<path>`
* All images are written into the directory `modules`/`module_name`/`assets/images`/`<path>`
* All examples are written into the directory `modules`/`module_name`/`examples`/`<type>`/`<path>`

When using paths to include, you might need to use the `module_name` when linking to another module,
but you must not use `pages`, `assets/images` or `examples` as the path component, only `<path>`.
See the examples in the relevant sections.
